# Work Day Scheduler

## Overview
This project was assigned as an application to store user events utilizing a save button that will be stored until the user clears the events intentionally. Starter code was provided to provide the basic html header framework and css styling. The assignment included the use of Moment.js in the browser to account for color-changing effects based on the time of day, and we are also utilizing third-party frameworks to put the app together more quickly and efficiently since the site is simple. 


## Project Description
The Acceptance Criteria for the project is as follows: 

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
